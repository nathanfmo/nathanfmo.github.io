      <h1>CSS Color Theory</h1>

    <main>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>When it comes to color choices, having more options is considered better.</p>
      <p>But with more options, comes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis" target="_blank">analysis paralysis</a> for what might be considered a small decision</p>
      <p>(Although I'm not going to deny the power of a good color scheme in marketing or any visual display)</p>
      <p>I find that having limited options leads to more creativity, since you have to work within boundaries and still create something spectacular.</p>
      <p>Consider the challenge that competitors on Top Chef have in distinguishing their dish from everyone else when they're all working with the same ingredient.</p>
      <p>Or the common exercise of writing a short story around a small prompt that writers of all skill levels will partake in to improve their writing.</p>
      <p>And so the self-imposed limit on colors for CSS will follow two rules</p>
      <ol>
        <li>They must be a named color present on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php" target="_blank">this list</a>.</li>
        <li>They must be able to be reduced to three characters in their hexadecimal code, AKA they have three pairs of characters.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>With this in mind, here is the resulting list</p>
      
      <h2>Colors</h2>
      <div id="black">
        <h3>Black</h3>
        <h4>#000</h4>
      </div>
      <div id="blue">
        <h3>Blue</h3>
        <h4>#00F</h4>
      </div>
      <div id="cyan">
        <h3>Cyan</h3>
        <h4>#0FF</h4>
      </div>
      <div id="">
        <h3></h3>
        <h4></h4>
      </div>
    </main>
